##Command 1: Spawn [Spawns a unit next to the nexus]
Type (type of unit to spawn)<br />

##Command 2: Move [moves a unit in a certain direction at a distance equal to the unit's movement speed]
ID (unit to be moved)<br />
Rotato (direction of movement)<br />

##Command 3: Attack [unit attacks another unit. If enemy is out of range, the attack will fail]
ID (unit that will attack)<br />
E_ID (unit being attacked)<br />


#Food
Food spawns randomly on the map symmetrically. Any unit that walks over food will collect 20 gold in reward and the food will then disappear.
